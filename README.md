# Music Player
A basic MP3 player using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player does various things like handling audio playback, managing a playlist, implementing play, pause, next, previous, and shuffle functionalities. The user can also dynamically update their user interface based on the current song. Essential string and array methods like the find(), forEach(), map(), and join() are used.
